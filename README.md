Modifed to allow browsing a website in pseudo-kiosk mode when experimenting with people with intellectual disability.
Benoit Favre, QUT, 2019

When launched, this app provides a field to enter a website address. Then, the app can be set as home / lanucher from the android settings so that most controls such as back / home buttons are inneffective. The original launcher can be set back to normal by modifying the home settings.

This app was created for facilitating experimentation with people with severe autism in the context of an information access project at QUT / Endeavour.
